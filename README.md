# Bipedal Walker Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains an implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for training a reinforcement learning model in the `BipedalWalker-v3` environment using PyTorch.

## Features

- **PPO Algorithm**: Implements the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm.
- **Actor-Critic Architecture**: Uses a neural network with shared layers for both the actor (policy) and critic (value function).
- **Training**: Episodic training for BipedalWalker-v3.
